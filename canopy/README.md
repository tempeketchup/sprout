### ⫸ **Welcome to the Network that Powers the Peer-to-Peer Launchpad for New Chains**

Built on a recursive architecture, chains bootstrap each other into independence —  
forming an `unstoppable` web of utility and security. 

**Here you'll find:**

➪ A recursive framework to build blockchains.

➪ The seed chain that started the recursive cycle.

## Network Status

⪢ Canopy is in `Betanet` 🚀 ➝ learn more about the [road-to-mainnet](https://www.canopynetwork.org/learn-more/road-to-mainnet)

## Protocol Documentation

➪ Check out the Canopy Network wiki:  [https://canopy-network.gitbook.io/docs](https://canopy-network.gitbook.io/docs)

## Repository Documentation

Welcome to the Canopy Network reference implementation. This repository can be well understood reading about the core modules:

- [Controller](controller/README.md): Coordinates communication between all the major parts of the Canopy blockchain, like a central hub or "bus" that connects the system together.
- [Finite State Machine (FSM)](fsm/README.md): Defines the logic for how transactions change the blockchain's state — it decides what’s valid and how state transitions happen from one block to the next.
- [Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) Consensus](bft/README.md): A consensus mechanism that allows the network to agree on new blocks even if some nodes are unreliable or malicious.
- [Peer-to-Peer Networking](p2p/README.md): A secure and encrypted communication system that lets nodes talk directly to each other without needing a central server.
- [Persistence](store/README.md): Manages the blockchain’s storage — it saves the current state (ledger), indexes past transactions, and ensures fast and reliable data verification.

## Prerequisites

➪ Before building Canopy, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Go** v1.24.0+ — [Download](https://go.dev/dl/)
- **Node.js** v18+ and **npm** — [Download](https://nodejs.org/)

## How to Run It

➪ To build and run the Canopy binary, use the following commands:

```bash
make build/canopy-full
canopy start
```

> **Note:** You must use `build/canopy-full` (not `build/canopy`) to ensure the wallet and explorer
> web apps are built before the Go binary. Running `build/canopy` alone will fail with
> `no matching files found` because the embedded web assets have not been generated yet.

➪ If you only want to build individual components:

```bash
make build/wallet      # Build the web wallet
make build/explorer    # Build the block explorer
make build/canopy      # Build the Go binary (requires wallet & explorer to be built first)
```

## How to Run It with 🐳 Docker

➪ To run a Canopy `Localnet` in a *containerized* environment, use the following commands:
```bash
make docker/build
make docker/up-fast
make docker/logs

or simply

make docker/up && make docker/logs
```

## Running Tests

➪ To run Canopy unit tests, use the Go testing tools:

```bash
make test
```

## How to Contribute

➪ Canopy is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community. Here's how to get involved:

1. **Fork** the repository and clone it locally.
2. **Code** your improvements or fixes.
3. **Submit a Pull Request** (PR) for review.

➣ Please follow these [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to maintain high-quality contributions:

### High Impact or Architectural Changes

➪ Before making large changes, discuss them with the Canopy team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pNcSJj7Wdh) to ensure alignment.

### Coding Style

- Code must adhere to official Go formatting (use [`gofmt`](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt)).
- (Optional) Use [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org) for consistent formatting.
- All code should follow Go documentation/commentary guidelines.
- PRs should be opened against the `development` branch.
